# Yağız Eraslan - Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a Unity Developer specializing in XR, Mobile, and Web development.

## Technologies Used

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React Icons

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually, you can do so with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, which can then be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
